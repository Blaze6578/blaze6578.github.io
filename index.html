<h2>Computers</h2>
<p>
<span style="font-family:'Lucida Handwriting';font-size:48">A</span> computer is a machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations (computation) automatically. Modern <span style="color:red">digital electronic computers</span> can perform generic sets of operations known as programs. <span style="font-family:'Lucida Handwriting'">These programs</span> enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks. A computer system is a nominally complete computer that includes the hardware, operating system (main software), and <span style="font-size:24">peripheral</span> equipment needed and used for full operation. This term may also refer to a group of computers that are linked and function together, <span style="font-family:papyrus">such as a computer network or computer cluster.</span>
